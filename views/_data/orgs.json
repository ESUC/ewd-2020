    "description": "Our club’s main focus is on group projects, in which we design, manufacture, and test using CAD software and 3D printing. Regardless of your background, major, or design experience, we are committed to teaching all our general members how to 3D print from the ground up. During the Fall Quarter, after we recruit new members, we will host weekly workshops to train everyone how to use CAD tools like Fusion360, and translate your designs into manufacturable prints. In addition to our group efforts, 3D4E also supports members with the resources and expertise they might need to pursue their own individual ideas. We work on quarter-long or year-long projects on topics like cosplay, RC cars, prosthetics, and wearable technology to showcase nationally with other 3D4E chapters. The best way to get in contact with us and get information on meetings is to join our Slack: https://tinyurl.com/y66br8vn. Our first meeting is on <b>October 8th (Week 1 Thursday) at 7 pm!</br>"

Our initiatives aim to serve everyone who has an interest in AI regardless of background, including people with no prior experience or knowledge in AI and non-CS majors. No application is required to attend our events. This fall ACM AI is offering three workshop series: Beginner Track, Advanced Track, and Applied ML. Beginner Track is an introductory course that teaches fundamentals of machine learning and assumes no prior background in AI. Advanced Track is a more advanced machine learning course that covers more advanced deep learning topics and is designed for students who have already previously taken Beginner Track or have prior knowledge of machine learning fundamentals. Our Applied ML workshops series covers practical skills needed to apply machine learning theory to real world problems and is designed for students who already have knowledge of machine learning fundamentals. UCLA is one of the world’s leading AI research producing institutions. This fall, ACM AI will be hosting a panel of world-class AI researchers from UCLA in a discussion on their ongoing work at UCLA, the greater AI research landscape, and how undergraduates can get involved. The best way for prospective members to get information on our events or contact us is our Facebook group. Our first info-session will be on Monday October 12 at 6:30PM on Zoom (zoom link will be posted in our Facebook group soon)."

All our events are open to anyone and everyone, even if you have no experience whatsoever.",
    "description": "Our mission is to create a community in which both experts and beginners alike can grow in the field of cybersecurity skills and knowledge. We want to make cybersecurity simple and accessible for everyone. To that end, we hold workshops and special events designed for beginners with no experience or just beginning in cybersecurity. <br>Each quarter we hold a series of Cyber Academy workshops focused on specific key topics in cybersecurity. This year, for Fall we have Forensics; Winter is Web Hacking; and in Spring we’ll cover Cryptography. All of our workshops don’t have prerequisites. Anyone is welcome. Feel free to come to one even if you had to miss a previous one! The major event we have each quarter is our CTF After Dark competitions, where you can join a team or go solo and solve cybersecurity challenges. We emphasize on making CTF After Dark very beginner friendly, as a fun introduction to CTF competitions. Feel free to participate even if you haven’t come to our workshops! <br>We post all our events’ information on our website, on our Facebook Page, and in our newsletter. Each week, we also send out an email about upcoming Cyber events, interesting Cybersecurity news, and write-ups about exploits and CTFs! <br>Be sure to check out the general ACM Fall GM on Monday, October 5 at 6:30pm, where you can hear more about all eight ACM committees.
